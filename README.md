##    Windows executable version:

Currently I do not have Windows machine, therefore temporary suspended the work.


###     Pure Java version (any platform where Java is available):

If you don't have preinstalled Java VM 8 or better on you computer, then
install Java 17. You can download the latest Oracle's Java from
http://java.oracle.com/ for your OS. MediaChest is also running on all Java flavors
on Linux systems. Since Oracle dropped supporting Java on Windows lower than XP,
you can consider to migrate to Linux with many benefits including MediaChest support.

If you want to use advanced features of the program, such as sending your 
albums or selections by e-mail, then some additional downloads can be required.

>Now, you're ready to launch the MediaChest. Since, the current version
doesn't include an installation software, you might need to modify
batch/script file by specifying a correct path to runtime class libraries,
and JVM. Note, you can use web started version, just paste the link:
http://mediachest.sf.net/mediachest/MediaChest.jnlp
in your browser and accept security warnings.
If you are going using E-Mail feature, then you have to specify
a correct class path for Java Mail API, and Activation Framework class
libraries. For remote control operation you need to have a communication
port Java library installed for your platform.
NOTE: that mentioned libraries are supplied with this distribution.
If extra libraries installed as extensions of JDK 1.8, then you can
launch the program by typing "java -jar MediaChest.jar", otherwise use
MediaChest.bat on Windows platforms, and ./MediaChest on Unix platforms.
Note that you may need to use chmod to allow MediaChest to execute after
inflating.
