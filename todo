1. smart playlit doesn't get updated after reading (fixed?)
2. artwork doesn't get added for image in ID3 tag, hangs on reading dimensions
3. song info doesn't get updated from ipod at sequential syncs

ad-hoc, queried smart lists
1. build database
2. execute a query and build a static list
3. group all songs in the list using grop name as a query
4. use this group in smart list with additional conditions, play count, song name and so on
5. utilize Derby

to finish:
1. copy playlists to host
2. export HTML including all or selected lists
3. import playlists from XML and other formats
4. date format in table view
6. Sync ID3 if required at merge lists
10. figure out if volume can be taken
11. Play and seek APE, FLAC, OGG

4. add icons in buttons of player
5. mark play now
6. tooltip for long song name
7. support players from OS

Extend song(s) info
1. add lyrics
2. add in properties file size, original name and file location, also volume db and maybe id3 tag version

3. after mass update tree need to be reshaped,
 genres for example can appear new or disappear some old
4. comment from db album should go to publishing too

Bugs
1. after finishing sync, all songs have to have ref to iPod location (not original)
2. when artwork changed in edit info and update tag is checked off, then update tag artwork
