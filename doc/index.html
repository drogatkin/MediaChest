<P><b>MediaChest </b> is an attempt to provide a centralized access to a personal collection
of media files from anywhere.
MediaChest gives not only a simple access,
it gives a fast access to only medias you want to listen, or view now and then. You are not limited to a particular platform or an
application. It doesn't matter what system or software you are using,&nbsp; as long as your system capable to run Java, or has a web browser.
MediaChest provides also many flexible ways to share some content of your media
collections with friends, colleagues, or enemies using FTP, SMTP, HTTP, or NNTP. You get a rich set of possibilities how to organize you
medias and provide different views suitable for particular purposes,
like dance party, romance, travel impressions sharing and so on. You
can create and update web site where you want to share your files, or
maybe you can host, so MediaChest can be transformed to a web server
itself and give you all its functionality remotely. You can post
your files in news group or send to somebody by e-mail. Back ended by
database and XML MediaChest is the way to store, access, and share
media files in controllable, and configurable way.</P>
<H3>A bit of history</H3>
<P>Two causes moved me to create this program:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Necessary to have a tool for
	renaming files produced by a digital camera to something unique and meaningful 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Prove that Java can resolve tasks where only native
	applications worked before 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;I was
amazed the results of first working version as in performance as in
functionality, so I decided continue work on the program adding
more and more features to it. The most complicated task after getting
encoding JPEG files was to create a good UI allowing easily utilize
all functionality of the program. Unfortunately, UI is still on heavy
development. Although I stopped work soon as got some version satisfied me,
appearing a free Java implementation of MP3 player was a boost of new development
transforming the original program to a multimedia files organizer.&nbsp;
Adding infrared remote control support (for irMan) made the
MediaChest ready to be the software for dedicated a la jukebox
computers.</P>
<H3>Features</H3>
<ol>

</ol>
<H3>iPod</H3>

<P>Ideally, iPod should keep all functionality I tried to implement
in MediaChest. Unfortunately, most of hardware vendors run behind the
train. I had to add iPod support simple because no one software
vendor doesn't provide it in terms of my usage. So here what I have
done and going to do:</P>
<P>1. Flexible way to copy music collection to iPod. Unfortunately,
there are many ways of how MP3 or other compressed music files reach
your computer. Many compression programs differently add/ or do not
add valuable information helping you to find music you'd like to
listen. Such programs as MusicMatch are attempts to do that, but not
in the way I think about it. I always want to have a control over how
my music will be organized.</P>
<P>2. Provide actual copy and storing all music collection on iPod.
Many modern programs consider iPod like a sort of PDA requiring
synchronization with a main computer.&nbsp; However, I have another
approach in mind thinking as Apple asked differently. What if keep
all music collection on iPod and use another storages only for backup
purpose? In this case iPod doesn't lose any files, unless a user
wants that.&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. Provide a real internationalization support.&nbsp; Files itself
and name in tag can be in any languages and character set and
MediaChest capable to correctly handle them.&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. Provide tight integration with MediaChest with alternative
approach of storing most of medias on iPod.</P>
<P>5. Support of smart playlists.</P>

you can find useful</A>.</P>

<H3>
    Creative Zen and Zune support</H3>
    <div>
        I'm about starting supporting devices using MTP protocol. Luckily there is a library
        for POSIX OS already. So a plan is write Java layer connected to JNI which will
        go natively to MTP on Windows platforms and use <a href="http://libmtp.sourceforge.net/">
            libmtp</a> on POSIX.</div>
            <table border="0" width="100%" id="table2">

		<td bgcolor="#FFFF00"><b><font color="#FF0000">I got Zune unit, so read my review <a href="http://7bee.j2ee.us/blog/2008/01/06/1199656500000.html">
                here</a>. Since a low interest to Zune and very limited capabilities of music organization, I drop plans for supporting it until an interest will be rosen.

    <h3>
        What is the current version</h3>
<P>The current version is relatively stable and requires JRE 1.7. Originally
MediaChest was JRE 1.1 compatible program, however I turned it in a lab to
leverage the latest technologies from Sun. Due good coverage of JRE 1.7 of all
popular platforms, like Solaris, Linux, Mac and all Windows it shouldn't be an
issue for many potential users. You can download <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://java.oracle.com/">JRE
1.7</a> from Oracle's web site, select your platform. You can also download JDK if 
you are planning to develop. Developers should also download
<a href="https://github.com/drogatkin/7Bee">Java build tool</a>.</P>
<H3>What will be in next versions</H3>
<P>I plan to improve all media formats support giving fast forward/back search and
file split and encoding.&nbsp; A lot of feature for new iPod support in
development now. CDDB integration for better tagging. Probably a real WavPack ripping will be here soon. I
think also add support of Raspberry Pi and Android</P>
<H3>Third parties tools used</H3>
<P>The MediaChest uses many third parties open source free Java
products:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Java MP3 layer for build MP3
	player. I really love this library and without it MediaChest simple
	didn't exist. Check this nice library out at
	<A HREF="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html</A>
		</P>
	<LI><P>MP3 id tag&nbsp; viewer/editor. This is also open source free Java 
	library. I did some modification, so provide a full source of this library 
	as it required by its license.</P>
	<LI>
	<P>MediaUtil (This is a branch project of MediaChest started with some 
	MediaChest's lossless Jpeg transformation capabilities). Now this is a 
	separate product including many nice features, so check it out
	<a href="/mediautil/">here</a>.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>IBM Toolkit for MPEG-4 SDK. This is closed source toolkit for playing
        MPEG-4 audio and video files also known as AAC. Check license agreement
        for this tool on IBM's site.</P>
        <li>Apple lossless player
        <li>Flac player
        <li>Ogg player
        <li>wavpack player
        <li>Audio monkey player
</OL>
<P>Nevertheless to say that exchangeable L&amp;F made the
program cool looking.&nbsp; If your OS is XP, then you can try a new
cool XP l&amp;F too.</P>
<P><I>All used third parties tools carry copyrights of their
authors.&nbsp;</I></P>
<H3><a name="download"></a>Download</H3>
<P>Since I am only one developer of the tool, I do not see any needs
to establish public CVS version. All sources provided in distributed
archives.&nbsp;MediaChest supports auto update (currently disabled), however
sources are provided for milestone builds.WebStarted version is also based on 
the latest source probably not released yet.&nbsp; MediUtil as a branch product 
of MediaChest has sourceforge hosted CVS, so I'd recommend to get latest sources 
from here, because this product is released not so frequently.</P>

<P>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35208">download 
the latest build</a>&nbsp;with lot playback improvements. Uses CVS version of <a href="/mediautil/">MediaUtil</a> *
</P>

<P><b><font color="#800000">Attention Windows 9x/Me users</font>: </b>: support of these systems has beed dropped, however support of Android is coming.</P>
<p>* The latest MediaChest requires updated version MediaUtil, so it uses the version built from CVS<p>
<a name="nb"></a><h4>Nightly build</h4>
<p>Nightly builds are planned to be resumed soon</p>

<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>Unzip the distributive archive with preserving directory structure and long
names, then run BAT or shell script in
dependency on your OS. JDK 1.6.0 is considered installed. Use chmod +x on POSIX systems  to
make a start script executable. Small editing
of start files can be required. See readme and iPod notice files for more
details about installation and features.</P>
