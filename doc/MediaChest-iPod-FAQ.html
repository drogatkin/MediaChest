<P><a name="1"></a>Q. How MediaChest differs from another well established programs
like iTunes, MC9, a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/">Anapod</a>,
YamiPod, ephPod or MMJB?</P>
<P>A. MediaChest just another program for doing similar task. The
major difference of this program that it is Java based, so can run
without modifications on many platforms. Another strong
side of MediaChest is NLS. If you have a lot music files with
description in languages not covered by Latin character set, then
MediaChest can be only choice. MediaChest is free and open source
program, so you can always be sure that no spy code in it, as annoying purchase
or registration reminders. 
</P>
<P><a name="2"></a>Q. Does MediaChest support MP3 ripping?</P>
<P>A. No, MediaChest doesn't' support direct MP3/AAC ripping. There is a
plan to add such support based on using an external encoder, like Lame, or Faac.</P>
<P><a name="3"></a>Q. Does MediaChest support ID3 tagging?</P>
<P>A. Yes, it supports tagging. Files can be tagged individually or
in a group. 
</P>
<P><a name="4"></a>Q. Can MediaChest do automatic tagging based on using CDDB or another
Internet music library? 
</P>
<P>A. Unfortunately, the current version can't do that, however there is a
strong plan to add such functionality. 
</P>
<P><a name="5"></a>Q. Can I use file name parts as fields of ID3 tag at ID3
tagging?</P>
<P>A. Yes, MediaChest allows to do that in a flexible way. It's very
convenient when you do a group tagging, and you can assign common
parts to all song, like artist and album and assign individual parts
based on file name, like title and track. Parts of file path can be also used
for automatic tagging.</P>
<P><a name="6"></a>Q. Can I use MediaChest with another iPod uploading software?</P>
<P>A. Yes, MediaChest can read information prepared by another
uploading software. However, MediaChest uses the latest version of
iTunesDB 1.92, witch can be non readable for such program as MC9 or MM. So,
there is a risk that you can't use your old program anymore without
restoring&nbsp; a backup of iTunesDB. You shouldn't have any problem using
iTunes version 4.x or better.</P>
<P><a name="7"></a>Q. What should I do to switch to MediaChest from my iPod uploading
program? Is there any risk of losing my songs uploaded to iPod?</P>
<P>A. Nothing required to change to start using MediaChest. There is
no risk losing songs, since MediaChest is compatible with all
versions of iTunesDB. However, programs used old iTunesDB formats may
not be working anymore.</P>
<P><a name="8"></a>Q. How MediaChest does synchronization? Is it different from other
programs?</P>
<P>A. MediaChest does only one way synchronization, it means that
songs added to iPod from other desktops won't be automatically
downloaded to the current desktop and song removed from a desktop won't be
removed from iPod. However, MediaChest has capability
to listen songs from iPod and copy selected songs to a desktop
computer. Another different of MediaChest is that any iTunesDB
modification doesn't happen instantly. To initiate a real process of
uploading files and modification of iTunesDB synchronization button
has to be pressed. So, synchronization here looks like
synchronization iPod with an image edited in memory. This approach
reduces number of exchanges with iPod that makes its disk less
fragmented and increases a speed of editing.</P>
<P><a name="9"></a>Q. How ID3 tag information mapped to records in iTunesDB?</P>
<P>A. When a file added to iPod, then it's ID3 tag used to populate
information in iTunesDB record, as title, album, artist, and others.
In addition, MediaChest can use information from directory path and
file name to fill any missed information from ID3 tag. A user can
edit any field of iTunesDB record at any time without affecting on
real content of ID3 tag. A user can also select option to override some ID3 tag
information from song file name or directory.</P>
<P><a name="10"></a>Q. Does MediaChest support group changes of iTunesDB record
information?</P>
<P>A. Yes, MediaChest allows to change iTunesDB records in a bunch.
Just select all records which need to be changed and select right
mouse menu item <B>View/Edit info....</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="11"></a>Q. Will corresponding ID3 tags changed
when information in iTunesDB changed?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Starting from build 128 you have such option.
AAC files excluded since editing tagging information isn't supported in them
yet. However, enable this option wisely since frequent editing ID3 tag of
version 2 can issue extra fragmentation on iPod hard disk. You shouldn't worry
if you use ID3 tags version 1.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="12"></a>Q. MediaChest is Java program, can I
use drag and drop?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, drag and drop fully supported,
so you can just drop files in iPod lists or tree. Sun's drag and drop
implementation has some bug preventing correct drop of files which
names are in UNICODE. In this case you need to use MediaChest files
explorer.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="13"></a>Q. Can I use national characters in
play list names?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, you can.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="14"></a>Q. Why song's information fields display any Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters
as squares even when I have fonts for these languages installed?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Sun's base implementation provides a support of
above languages only if the current operating system is localized for this languages.&nbsp;
If you have Windows NT installed as English, then commonly you cannot see these
characters even you have a corrected <i> font.properties</i> file and specified right
locale (like zh_TW) in MediaChest options. However, it doesn't prevent of copying your
song information to iPod in right coding. If seeing these languages is
critical for you, then you can install a font with above languages and select it
in font combobox of miscellaneous options. Note that latest version of Windows
have font <font face="MingLiU">MingLiU</font> installed when support Asian
languages selected.&nbsp;</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="15"></a>Q. When I add music files in iPod layout, I see
song names and other information in national alphabets corrupted, what can be a
problem?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. ID3 tag can contains information encoded, for
example in BIG5 encoding. To see your information not
distorted you need to specify correct encoding in miscellaneous options. This
option is applied dynamically, so you can re-add your music many times until you
found a right encoding.&nbsp;If you do not know what is hidden behind short
encoding name, then you can use <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html">this
reference</a>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="16"></a>Q. I can see that the same artist or album is listed more than one time in
a corresponding tree, what's wrong and can it be
fixed?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. It usually happens when artist's
name specified slightly differently, for example in different case,
or there is an extra blank or article THE, or S on the end.
MediaChest helps to fix that providing merge list options. Just
select all list you would like to make one and select right mouse
menu Merge. Please, aware that MediaChest doesn't show a result of
merging immediately, if you would like see them before uploading to
iPod just select refresh.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="17"></a>Q. Do I need to do synchronization
first, before starting adding files to iPod?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. No, you can start adding files
without synchronization and make it later.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="18"></a>Q. Does MediaChest supports undo? I
did some modifications in names, deleted files, but want to revert them back.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. The current version doesn't support
undo yet, however you have several choices to revert changed
information to previous state. For example to make it the same as in
ID3 tag, you can initiate ID3 editing and close edit dialog without
actual editing, then information from ID3 tag will be populated in
iTunesDB record. Or you can select right mouse menu Rebuild database
from iPod. Or, you can Start Over
    at time of adding new songs.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="19"></a>Q. My VBR songs have incorrect time
after uploading them using MediaChest, how can I fix the problem?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. MediaChest uses Xing VBR header
information to accurately calculate length of a song, however such
header can be missed, corrupted or not existent. In this case you can
manually correct length of a song using editing in place feature of
MediaChest. You can also reduce pause after song if make this time a
bit shorter for regular songs.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="20"></a>Q. I want to see more or less fields
about my files stored on iPod, can I do that?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, it's configurable in an appearance tab of
a settings dialog.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="21"></a>Q. I want to support my own
directories structure for storing song on iPod hard disk, can I do
that using MediaChest?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, it's possible. You need to check off <font color="#000080"> Maintain album folders</font>
in iPod options panel. In this case song source
directory structure will be copied to iPod's disk. Information from
ID3 tag isn't used for maintaining folders since it optionally presented in files. If you want to have a completely own directory
structures on iPod, then you can also do that. However, you need to
copy files to iPod with desired directories using third parties
program as Explorer or any other file manager (or just command line).  After copying files
you need to do synchronization with selected option <font color="#000080"> Action with unknown
files &ndash; Restore in database</font>. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="22"></a>Q. MediaChest displays song, album,
and artist lists unsorted, is there any way to sort them?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. MediaChest display songs sorted accordingly
track number if present or in order of adding song. Album, Artist, Composer are
sorted using the same rules as iPod firmware does that.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="23"></a>Q. Can I add songs encoded using AAC or WAV
encoding?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, this functionality is supported for AAC,
and WAV only. You can't only edit&nbsp; tags in AAC or WAV files. Editing tag information in AAC
files is planning.</P>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="24"></a>Q. Many iPod uploaders support ratings, play
counts, and last listen time for songs, can I get these features from MediaChest?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, you can. MediaChest supports not only
reading these information, but editing them and use for forming play lists.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="25"></a>Q. Many iPod uploader programs support <font color="#800080">Smart
Play List (smart playlist)</font>, what about MediaChest?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. MediaChest fully supports Smart Play List. It
even give some unique features not supported by iTunes, for example order by
year.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="26"></a>Q. I can't find how to create Smart PlayList in
MediaChest, is it any trick here?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. To do not alter Apple trade mark for the name,
Smart Play List named as Magic Play List in MediaChest.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="27"></a>Q. If I built Smart Play List based on other play
list or group, then I got it empty on iPod, although it shown filled in
MediaChest. How to avoid that?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. It seems that 3g iPod firmware doesn't
support Smart PlayLists with live update
    built on certain conditions. So, make sure that
you have no <b> Live update </b> checked off for such lists.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="28"></a>Q. Does MediaChest support reading and&nbsp; saving of On-The-Go
lists?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, such lists are completely supported. You
can delete or rename on-the-go lists as well. Saved on-the-go lists are
supported too. </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="34"></a>Q. What 4 different on-the-go 
options mean?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. iPod stores on-the-go playlists out of 
iTunesDB, so MediaChest provides 4 options here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Ignore OTG, in this case on-the-go list 
	ignored in sync operations and you can't see on-the-go content in MediaChest</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Create OTG as playlis, in this case 
	MediaChest convert every on-the-go list to a regular iTunesDB playlist 
	trying to assign it an unique name. Such playlists will be included in sync 
	operations. Original ot-the-go on iPod will be deleted.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Added to previous OTG, in this case all 
	content on-the-go lists appended to the same on-the-go playlist. It allows 
	to eliminate creation a big number of on-the-go lists on every sync 
	operation.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">Do not save OTG, in this case content of 
	on-the-go list will be displayed, however it won't be saved as iTunesDB 
	playlist. So, there is a chance to move songs from on-the-go list to other 
	playlist to keep them saved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="29"></a>Q. Why songs listed in Smart Play Lists can be
ordered differently in MediaChest and in iPod?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. The problem related that Apple and the rest of
the world sort national alphabets differently. Actually Apple approach can be
considered more logical since places national characters first.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="30"></a>Q. Why Smart Play List shown by MediaChest and
iPod can contain different entries? </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. MediaChest uses case insensitive criteria when
decides to add or not items in a list, when iPod/iTunes uses case sensitive approach.
It makes sense only for live play lists, so enhancement to use case sensitive
criteria for a live play list is pending. </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="31"></a>Q. I own iPod photo/video/classic, how can I
make my album artwork visible, when I use MediaChest?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. This feature supported since build 129.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="32"></a>Q. I need to copy some songs
back to my PC hard drive, can I do that?</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, you can select files, or albums and
use right button menu to copy the selection.</p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="33"></a>Q. Can I get content of my iPod
as HTML file? </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, check export options under file menu. In
addition to HTML you can get XML, CSV, and some other play list formats.</p>



<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="34"></a>Q. Can I manage video content? </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. Yes, MediaChest provides capability to copy video content to and from iPod.
However it doesn't verify that video content is in correct format playbale by iPod</p>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="35"></a>Q. Does MediaChest support photo copying? </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. This functionality is currently in development.</p>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><a name="36"></a>Q. Why MediaChest reminds me about unfinished tasks at exiting although I just 
    succeeded a sync? </p>
<p STYLE="font-weight: medium">A. You may have magic (smart) play lists without <b>Live update</b> checked off. In this case condition of the list can
be continuously changed, so MediaChest reminds about possible updating. just ignore the message or make all lists live updateable..</p>
