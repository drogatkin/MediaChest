<h2><a name="S1"></a>Subject: [1] Common
questions related to MediaChest and iPod extension</h2>
<p>These are intended to be brief (if somewhat incomplete) answers to basic
questions. More detailed information can be found later in the FAQ. For example,
<a href="#S1-5">section (1-5)</a>, &quot;?&quot;, is answered in far more detail
in <a href="http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq07.html#S7-6">section (7-6)</a>.
<h3><a name="S1-1"></a>Subject: [1-1] What's MediaChest?<br>
<font size="-2">(1999/12/19)</font></h3>
<p>MediaChest if a free distributed Java application with complete sources helps
to find as answers on common happened programming question as organizes media
files different types for easy viewing, listening, etc.</p>
<p>Subject: What is recommended way to enter my media files to be organized by
MediaChest?</p>
<p>You can fall in one of group of potential users of MediaChest:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You just bought a digital camera and want to move taken pictures in a
    computer see section (2-1)</li>
  <li>You already own a camera for awhile and want to organize already taken
    pictures</li>
  <li>You have no digital camera, but you have image files and want to organize
    them</li>
</ol>
<p>Subject: How to enter picture from a digital camera?</p>
<p>The current version does not support direct communication to a digital
camera, although this possibility is my plans. When the program started
developed, only serial protocol was supported and it was extremely slow and not reliable,
so the program was oriented to use flush card readers. Most of flush card
readers will create a virtual disk presenting your card. You need to specify
this disk </p>
